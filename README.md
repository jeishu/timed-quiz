## Language

I used JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I did initially used jQuery framework, but switch over back to vanilla JavaScript. The jQuery code can be found on './js/jQuery.js'

## Code-Example

HTML: There isn't much in HTML. There are 5 sections acting as pages, their class name is .___Page
```
<div class="homePage">
    <h1>JavaScript Quiz</h1>

    <!-- button paths to the rules page -->
    <div class="homeStartBtn">Start Quiz</div>
    <!-- button for the highscores -->
    <div class="homeLbBtn">Leaderboard</div>
</div>
```

CSS: A good 99% of the styling is in CSS. All buttons are made from div tags with hover styling.
```
.homeStartBtn:hover, 
.homeLbBtn:hover, 
.rulesHomeBtn:hover, 
.rulesStartBtn:hover,
.lbHomeBtn:hover,
.formHomeBtn:hover,
.formLbBtn:hover {
    cursor: pointer;
    color: #f5f5f5;
    background: rgb(202, 202, 202);

    transition: .5s;
}
```

JavaScript: Sections are being shown as pages through the style.display = ""; in JS
```
homeStartBtnEl.addEventListener("click", function() {
    let rulesHide = true;

    if (rulesHide === true) {
        homePageEl.style.display = "none";
        rulesPageEl.style.display = "block";
        lbPageEl.style.display = "none";
        quizPageEl.style.display = "none";
    }
});
```

jQuery: The framework was replaced by vanilla JavaScript.
```
 homeStartBtnEl.on("click", function() {
    let rulesHide = true;

    if (rulesHide === true) {
        homePageEl.hide();
        rulesPageEl.show();
        lbPageEl.hide();
        quizPageEl.hide();
    }
});
```

## Reference

These are websites I used to aid me in learning different syntax and different methods, functions, etc for Javascript.

> - [Developer Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
> - [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/)
> - [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com/)

These websites aid me in creating this README.md

> - [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) || Learn most of my README syntax here.

## Tests/Issues

> jQuery
- I started off using jQuery, but learn that so functions and methods within jQuery likes being used with other jQuery methods and functions.
- Being limited in my knowledge in jQuery, I switched to vanilla JavaScript.
- The learning process definitely help me learn and get more comfortable with JS and jQuery.
> Syntax, Misspell, etc
- Most of my problems within my code is that I would forget I set a variable to one name and make another.
- I would forget to capitalize when needed to stay consistent.
> Score Keeping
- I had a good amount of issues getting my scores rendering out.
- At first came out undefined, but Dan, a good classmate of mine, was able to help me see some syntax and misspell errors.

## Contribute/Credits

- My class instructor, Calvin
- My tutor, Sangeetha
- Dan, the extra eye that saw my problem with why my score rendering and name rendering was undefined.
